## What is CS50AI?

CS50AI is an introduction to the concepts and applications of artificial intelligence (AI) through Python programming. The course emphasizes both the theory and practical implementation of AI algorithms. It is designed for beginners who are eager to dive into the world of AI and Python programming, even without prior AI experience.

The course is part of the renowned **CS50 series**, which is widely recognized for its emphasis on hands-on learning and project-based approaches. By the end of CS50AI, you will have gained a solid foundation in AI concepts and applied them to real-world problems.

## What Will You Study in CS50AI?

Throughout the course, you will explore the following topics:

### **1. Search Algorithms**
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- A* Search
- Greedy Best-First Search
- Real-world applications, such as solving mazes and route planning.

### **2. Knowledge Representation**
- Logic and propositional reasoning.
- Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs).
- Applications like solving Sudoku puzzles.

### **3. Uncertainty**
- Introduction to probability and Bayesian networks.
- Decision-making under uncertainty.

### **4. Machine Learning**
- Supervised learning: Regression and classification.
- Unsupervised learning: Clustering.
- Applications in real-world datasets.

### **5. Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- Tokenization, stemming, and sentiment analysis.
- Building a search engine with textual data.

### **6. Neural Networks**
- Basics of deep learning and neural network architectures.
- Training and optimizing models.
- Applications in image recognition and more.

### **7. Reinforcement Learning**
- Markov decision processes.
- Applications like teaching agents to play games.
